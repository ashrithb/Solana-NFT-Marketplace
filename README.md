# Solana-NFT-Marketplace
Welcome to the Solana-NFT-Marketplace! This was the project that my team worked on at Solana, and I have included some screenshots to showcase our finished product. The whole product was built using Node.js, Rust, Javascript, and Typescript integrated with Auction Houseâ€™s API. Some features we implemented were the ability to mint SOL tokens and use them to purchase NFTs, creating listings for NFTs, and the ability to buy NFTs with web3 wallets, all while being connected to Solana's devnet with the ability to view how many coins you had leftover and such. In addition to making this project developer friendly for the future, we supported fixed-price and auctioned transactions, listing and de-listing NFTs, in conjunction with mobile support. These options were supported by a profile page, and a dynamic main page for the NFT marketplace that one could browse and click through NFTs individually or by looking at all of them.
