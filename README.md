# Solana-NFT-Marketplace
Welcome to the Solana-NFT-Marketplace! This was the project that my team worked on at Solana, and I have included some screenshots of our finished product. Some features we implemented, were the ability to mint SOL tokens and use them to purchase NFTs, the uploading of NFTs, and the ability to buy NFTs, all while being connected to Solana's devnet with the ability to view how many coins you had leftover and such. These options were supported by a profile page, and a dynamic main page for the NFT marketplace that one could browse and click through NFTs individually or by looking at all of them.
